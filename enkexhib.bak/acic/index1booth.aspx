                                <strong>What is an EAC (exhibitor appointed contractor)</strong>
                                <p>Exhibitors may employ the service of independent contractors to install and dismantle their display; providing the Exhibitor and the installation and dismantling contractor comply with the following requirements <a href="http://www.enkshows.com/pdf/acic/2014/jan/acic-eac.pdf" target="_blank">(See Exhibitor appointed contractor)</a>.</p>

                                 7000 Lindell Road<br/>

                                <strong>How do I purchase insurance for the show?</strong>
                                <p>Each Exhibitor should secure adequate insurance protection against loss of, or damage to, equipment,  merchandise  and  display  materials,  from  any  cause,  and  against  loss  through personal injury to himself, his employees or to visitors to its Exhibit Booth. Check with your agent -- perhaps you are already covered on a Floater Policy. Or, a suggestion is to arrange for all-risk coverage, which may be done by "riders" to existing policies.</p>
                                <!-- Question 4 -->
                                <strong>Are children allowed on the show floor during set-up and dismantle?</strong>
                                <p>All ENK Exhibitions are family friendly.  On show days only, children are welcome; remember to bring what you need, as shopping for necessities will be inconvenient. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted in the exhibition facility during move-in or move-out.</p>
                                <!-- Question 5 -->
                                <strong>How do I get the dimensions of the panels in the booth?</strong>
                                <p>The Booth panels are solid white. Visual Panel Dimensions: each one-meter panel is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" thick, 37 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>" wide and 89 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" high; each half-meter panel is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" thick, 18 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" wide and 89 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>" high. Actual Panel Dimensions: each one-meter panel is 38 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" wide and 91 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>" high; half-meter panel is <br/> 18 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" wide x 91 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>" high. Refer to Booth Dimensions &amp; Package details in Guidebook.</p>

                                <strong>What are the height restrictions for my booth?</strong>
                                <p>There is an 8' height limit for all Booth walls, mannequins, fixtures, lights, signs, auto poles and merchandise.  In addition, nothing (merchandise, signs, chairs, shelves, walls, etc.) may extend beyond your assigned exhibit space into the aisle. ENK adopted this standard trade show rule so that all Exhibitors have equal visibility and are not blocking the sight line of a neighboring booth.</p>

                                <p>You will receive an email communication from ENK providing you with a personalized user name and password so that you may order your badges in advance.

                                <p>Badges ordered by the deadline will be mailed in advance of the show except for Display House and Mover Staff. Badges ordered after the deadline date will be available for pick up at exhibitor registration during move-in or show days. All exhibitors are required to wear a badge to gain entry to the show as well as all times while on the show floor.

                                <p>Orders may be placed with GES without a booth number and/or if you are unsure of your booth size. If the order is placed before the deadline you can always revise/update your order and still receive the advance price.

                                <p>All electrical connections must be made under the supervision of an authorized Facility electrician. All electrical equipment must be Underwriter Laboratories (UL) approved. Thin brown or white extension cords are against NYC fire laws. The official facility electrical services contractor reserves the right to make reasonable adjustments to your lighting fixtures if they are not sufficiently supported or your set up is considered a hazard.  For your safety, any adjustments to booth lights must be made by the official facility electrical contractor labor and cannot be done by an exhibitor, display house, etc. Please do not try to adjust or alter the lights in any way by yourself. If you need help, please go to the Electric Service Desk and they will have someone come to your booth to accommodate your request.

                                <!-- Question 1 -->
                                <strong>What is the difference between empty storage and secured storage?</strong>
                                <p>Empty storage is just that. It is empty boxes stored for you during Show days. Once the empty boxes are placed in Empty Storage you will not have access to them (they are stored offsite).  They will be returned beginning after the show closes on the last show day.  It will take anywhere from 4-8 hours to return all empties to the exhibitor's booth and this process will begin after the aisle carpet is removed.  Please make your travel plans accordingly.  Please be advised that samples left inside boxes placed in empty storage can be stolen! Samples, etc. should be placed in the Secured Storage Room.</p>
                                <p>Secured storage is a complementary service provided by ENK for exhibitors to store extra samples, merchandise, etc. Loose merchandise will not be accepted.  Security will log the number of boxes, suitcases, etc. you check into the Secured Storage room; they will not count the merchandise within the box, suitcase, etc. The Secured Storage Room will have a guard stationed outside the room on a 24-hour basis.  The Secured Storage Room is not large enough to accept empty suitcases, boxes, crates, etc.  These must be stored in GES' empty storage by placing an "empty" label on each item with your booth number clearly written on the label.</p>

You may perform any work with regard to the unpacking and placement of your product, as well as the removal and re-packing of your product. Under no circumstances should you become involved in disputes regarding labor to be performed. Refer all questions to GES or ENK. Make sure that all personnel working in your Booth are familiar with these union regulations. Place any labor orders with GES in advance, to help assure that the required work can be done in the most economical fashion.

All materials checked into the Secured Storage Room must be secured in a box, suitcase, garment bag, etc. Loose merchandise will not be accepted. Security will log the number of boxes, suitcases, etc. you check into the Secured Storage Room; they will not count the merchandise within the box, suitcase, etc. Upon retrieving your merchandise the following day, you will be asked to sign for your boxes/garment bags. The Secured Storage Room will have a guard stationed outside the room on a 24-hour basis. The Secured Storage Room is not large enough to accept empty suitcases, boxes, crate or display materials you elected not to use within your booth, etc. These must be stored in GES' empty storage by placing an "empty" label on each item with your booth number clearly written on the label.</p>

Exhibitors with small loads may unload their own vehicle with their own dollies. (Facility/GES dollies may be used by the Facility/GES labor only and are not for Exhibitor's use.) Forklift service is not available in this area. If you need assistance unloading your vehicle, please check-in at the GES Porter desk at the entrance to the Show (service is on a first- come/serve basis). You must have two people with each vehicle to unload in this area: one to stay with the vehicle and one to bring the merchandise into your Booth.

                                <p>If your shipment is not picked up by the scheduled move-out time, it will be "forced" by GES on to the next available carrier at the Exhibitor's expense.

                                <p>First, you should locate your shipping paperwork (in most cases, this is your copy of the carrier's bill of lading or tracking number). Call your carrier to verify the shipment has been delivered.  If the carrier has delivered your shipment obtain the date, time and signature of the person that signed for the shipment.  Take that information to the GES freight desk so they can assist you in tracking your materials.</p>
