            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>What is an EAC (exhibitor appointed contractor)</h4>
            <p>Exhibitors may employ the service of independent contractors to install and dismantle their display; providing the Exhibitor and the installation and dismantling contractor comply with the following requirements <a href="../assets/pdf/fc/fc-eac.pdf" target="_blank">(See Exhibitor appointed contractor)</a>.</p>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <h4>How do I purchase insurance for the show?</h4>
            <p>Each Exhibitor should secure adequate insurance protection against loss of, or damage to, equipment,  merchandise  and  display  materials,  from  any  cause,  and  against  loss  through personal injury to himself, his employees or to visitors to its Exhibit Booth. Check with your agent -- perhaps you are already covered on a Floater Policy. Or, a suggestion is to arrange for all-risk coverage, which may be done by "riders" to existing policies.</p>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <h4>Are children allowed on the show floor during set-up and dismantle?</h4>
            <p>All ENK Exhibitions are family friendly.  On show days only, children are welcome; remember to bring what you need, as shopping for necessities will be inconvenient. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted in the exhibition facility during move-in or move-out</p>
            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <h4>How do I get the dimensions of the panels in the booth?</h4>
            <p>The Booth panels are solid white. Visual Panel Dimensions: each one-meter panel is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" thick, 37 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>" wide and 89 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" high; each half-meter panel is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" thick, 18 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>" wide and 89 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>" high.

            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <h4>What are the height restrictions for my booth?</h4>
            <p>There is an 8' height limit for all Booth walls, mannequins, fixtures, lights, signs, auto poles and merchandise.  In addition, nothing (merchandise, signs, chairs, shelves, walls, etc.) may extend beyond your assigned exhibit space into the aisle. ENK adopted this standard trade show rule so that all Exhibitors have equal visibility and are not blocking the sight line of a neighboring booth.</p>

          <a href="#" class="faq-question">Empty Storage</a>
          <div class="faq-content">
            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>What is the difference between empty storage and secured storage?</h4>
            <p>Empty storage is just that. It is empty boxes stored for you during Show days. Once the empty boxes are placed in Empty Storage you will not have access to them (they are stored offsite).  They will be returned beginning after the show closes on the last show day.  It will take anywhere from 4-8 hours to return all empties to the exhibitor's booth and this process will begin after the aisle carpet is removed.  Please make your travel plans accordingly.  Please be advised that samples left inside boxes placed in empty storage can be stolen! Samples, etc. should be placed in the Secured Storage Room.</p>
            <p>Secured storage is a complementary service provided by ENK for exhibitors to store extra samples, merchandise, etc. Loose merchandise will not be accepted.  Security will log the number of boxes, suitcases, etc. you check into the Secured Storage room; they will not count the merchandise within the box, suitcase, etc. The Secured Storage Room will have a guard stationed outside the room on a 24-hour basis.  The Secured Storage Room is not large enough to accept empty suitcases, boxes, crates, etc.  These must be stored in GES' empty storage by placing an "empty" label on each item with your booth number clearly written on the label.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <h4>Can I store my empties behind my booth?</h4>
            <p>Fire regulations prohibit anyone from storing anything behind the booth walls, columns or any unauthorized areas.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>Do I need to hire Union Labor to set-up / dismantle my booth?</h4>
            <p>Exhibitors are required to use qualified union personnel to perform various services at the Exhibit Facility. All crates, whether containing exhibit materials or samples, must be "opened" by union personnel. Union labor is required for set-up and dismantling of displays. You may perform any work with regard to the unpacking and placement of your product, as well as the removal and re-packing of your product. Under no circumstances should you become involved in disputes regarding labor to be performed. Refer all questions to GES or ENK. Make sure that all personnel working in your Booth are familiar with these union regulations. Place any labor orders with GES in advance, to help assure that the required work can be done in the most economical fashion.

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>Will there be security?</h4>
            <p>ENK will have professional perimeter guard service at the Show throughout move-in, Exhibition hours and move-out.  However, this exhibition is an open Booth show and you are responsible for the security of your exhibit space and merchandise.  While ENK will exercise reasonable care in safeguarding your property, neither ENK, nor any of its officers, agents or employees assume any responsibility for such property, or carry any insurance on Exhibitors' merchandise or fixtures.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <h4>How do I secure my booth outside of show hours?</h4>
            <p>Pre-show, you may hire a private guard through Citadel Security, ENK's exclusive security company, at 718.948.3658, or order Booth Seal. Refer to the online order form to order a Private Guard or Booth Seal. Security guards requested at show site cannot be guaranteed.</p>
            <!-- Question 3 -->

The Secured Storage Room is not large enough to accept empty suitcases, boxes, crate or display materials you elected not to use within your booth, etc. These must be stored in GES' empty storage by placing an "empty" label on each item with your booth number clearly written on the label.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>What is Material Handling/Drayage and is it included with my shipping cost?</h4>
            <p>Material handling, often referred to as drayage, is the movement of your freight from the carrier to your booth and then back to the carrier at the close of the show.  Material handling charges are computed based on the weight of your materials. The weight is rounded up to the closest hundred pounds (cwt.) and charged according to the rates published in guidebook/online order form.  ENK has paid for the first 500 lbs. of freight handling charges within the exhibit facility.</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <h4>What is a Bill of Lading? </h4>
            <p>Exhibitors that will be using the freight dock must complete a Bill of Lading <a href="../assets/pdf/fc/fc-feb2014-bill-of-lading.pdf" target="_blank">(See Bill of Lading)</a>. This form tells GES who is sending the shipment, where the shipment is going, the number of pieces, how it is being shipped and who is responsible for the charges. The Bill of Lading can be picked up from the Exhibitor Service Desk once your account with them has been paid.</p>

            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <h4>Can I unload my own vehicle?</h4>
            <p>Passenger cars and vans may be unloaded at the front entrance of the Facility. A Citadel/GES representative will direct you to the next available unloading area. Park your vehicle as close to the vehicle next to you as possible; this will allow for the maximum amount of vehicles to unload simultaneously. Exhibitors with small loads may unload their own vehicle with their own dollies. (Facility/GES dollies may be used by the Facility/GES labor only and are not for Exhibitor's use.) Forklift service is not available in this area. If you need assistance unloading your vehicle, please check-in at the GES Porter desk at the entrance to the Show (service is on a first- come/serve basis). You must have two people with each vehicle to unload in this area: one to stay with the vehicle and one to bring the merchandise into your Booth. If you are being dropped off by taxi, limo, etc. you do not need to have two people to unload. All vehicles must be moved immediately after unloading to allow for other Exhibitors.</p>
            <!-- Question 7 -->
            <h4>Do you offer assistance with hand carried items?</h4>
            <p>Yes, ENK provides complementary Porter Service.  Please check-in at the GES Porter desk at the entrance to the Show (service is on a first- come/serve basis).</p>
            <!-- Question 8 -->
            <h4>What is forced freight? </h4>
            <p>If your shipment is not picked up by the scheduled move-out time, it will be "forced" by GES on to the next available carrier at the Exhibitor's expense. If you have an unpaid balance with GES, your shipment will be brought to the GES warehouse and not released until GES fees are paid in full. In addition to shipping charges for forcing the freight you may also incur storage fees.</p>
            <!-- Question 9 -->
            <h4>How do I track my shipment if my freight is missing or not in my booth when I arrive? </h4>
            <p>First, you should locate your shipping paperwork (in most cases, this is your copy of the carrier's bill of lading or tracking number). Call your carrier to verify the shipment has been delivered.  If the carrier has delivered your shipment obtain the date, time and signature of the person that signed for the shipment.  Take that information to the GES freight desk so they can assist you in tracking your materials.</p>

            <!-- Question 10 -->
            <h4>How do I ship my materials after the close of the show?</h4>
            <p>All merchandise, samples, etc. must be removed from the exhibit facility by 8:00PM on the last show day. Carefully pack your exhibit materials and merchandise. Pay close attention so you do no not leave anything behind. Exhibitors must prepare the proper documents for the shipment of their merchandise, such as a Material Handling form. The Material Handling form tells GES who is sending the shipment, where the shipment is going, the number of pieces, how it is being shipped and who is responsible for the charges. These forms, which will be available from the Exhibitor Service Desk, must be submitted to GES prior to leaving the exhibit facility. Please be sure that all shipping information and a form of payment are in the hands of all persons who will be breaking down your Booth.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h4>What is the average length of time for customs clearance?</h4>
            <p>Currently it takes from 1-3 business days to clear air freight shipments and 3-5 days to clear ocean freight shipments through U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  If the shipments are chosen for intensive exam, the goods must be transported to an examination station and an additional 5-10 days will be added to the clearance time.U.S. Customs operating hours are 8am-4:30pm (Eastern) weekdays (Monday-Friday Only).</p>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <h4>Why should I hire a broker? </h4>
            <p>The customs brokerage firm will be mainly responsible for the smooth shipment of goods and preparation of all legal documents for customs clearance.  A good customs broker is equipped with up-to-date knowledge and technology to deal with customs officers and overcome the barriers.
